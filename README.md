# About the Game
This game is a project made for the course CMSC425 at the  University of Maryland. <br>
It was built over a semester using the Unity Game engine with C# as the programming language. <br>
All graphics and textures were downloaded from the Unity Asset Store or some other source of free assets. <br>
The files located in the "Assets/Code" directory were all written by myself and are my original code.  <br>
If you would like to play the game, follow the installation steps below. <br>
# Installation
To play the game, you must have the Unity game engine and Unity Hub installed on your machine. <br>
First, clone the files in the repository. <br>
Then, open Unity Hub and click the "ADD" button and navigate to where you cloned the project files.  <br>
Once you add the files, a new project should appear in the project dashboard which you can click to run the game.  <br>
After a minute or two of setup, the Unity game engine should launch. If the game scene looks blank, go to the project file structure in the engine and navigate to "Assets/Scenes" and double click on "Main". This should load the game scene. <br> 
To play the game, click the small play button in the top middle of the screen. <br>
Enjoy!
