# About the Game
This game is a project made for the course CMSC425 at the  University of Maryland.
It was built over a semester using the Unity Game engine with C# as the programming language. 
All graphics and textures were downloaded from the Unity Asset Store or some other source of free assets.
The files located in the "Assets/Code" directory were all written by myself and are my original code. 
If you would like to play the game, follow the installation steps below.


# Installation
To play the game, you must have the Unity game engine and Unity Hub installed on your machine.
First, clone the files in the repository.
Then, open Unity Hub and click the "ADD" button and navigate to where you cloned the project files. 
Once you add the files, a new project should appear which you can click to run the game. 
After a minute or two of setup, the Unity game engine should launch. If the game scene looks blank, go to the project file structure in the engine and navigate to "Assets/Scenes" and double click on "Main". This should load the game scene.
To play the game, click the small play button in the top middle of the screen.
Enjoy!
